# Cogni: An AI Framework Written in C++

## Overview

Cogni is an ongoing project, developed concurrently with another project named Kitsune. This framework, written in C++, is designed to serve the specific needs of Kitsune. The primary goal is to develop a deep understanding of the algorithms involved by engaging directly in their creation and refinement.

## Research and Development Approach

At the core of Cogni is a commitment to rigorous research. Each function is carefully crafted, with a focus on tracing the historical development of the algorithms. This includes acknowledging original research, subsequent advancements, and state-of-the-art modifications. All referenced papers are linked and cited to ensure academic integrity and to provide context for the development process.

## Naming Conventions

In terms of naming conventions, Cogni aligns with those established by PyTorch. This decision is rooted in the desire for consistency and familiarity, particularly for users acquainted with PyTorchâ€™s structure.

## Evolutionary Nature of Cogni

The development of Cogni is inherently linked to the needs of Kitsune. As such, updates to this framework might appear irregular or contextually isolated. These updates, though seemingly sporadic, are integral to addressing the evolving requirements of Kitsune, reflecting the adaptive and responsive nature of this project.

## Participation and Contribution

The scientific and development community is invited to engage with Cogni. Contributions, whether in the form of feedback, collaboration, or usage, are valuable to the continuous evolution of this framework.

Cogni represents an ongoing journey in the realms of algorithm development and application, driven by a scientific and methodical approach.
